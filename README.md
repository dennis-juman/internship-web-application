Date: 27-01-2020 (European notation). This web application has been built by me at the last month of my internship at the Digital Society School - Hogeschool van Amsterdam (University of Applied Sciences).

Before you can understand what this application is meant for, you will have to understand a bit more about the company. Since this application has been purely built for their needs.

The Digital Society School's services keep expanding. They offer courses, tracks and more. Each semester people apply for tracks. These tracks contain projects from which the applicant can apply for. If the applicant is hired for the position then he/she will work on that project for the next 5 months.

The applicants that take part of these track projects create resources during their 5 months of hard work, with resources I mean; images, documents, videos, presentations etc. These files need to be stored somewhere and each year a new semester opens which means the data keeps expanding and becomes harder to manage and keeping track of. They needed a new solution to manage their data. The company I worked for needed a new secure solution to easily find and structure their upcoming and current data.

That is what this application is for. It makes sure that the data being submitted in a strict and structured manner. This application has been coded dynamically. 

You can:
upload new projects using this applicatio
Search and filter existing projects using this application (search functionality)
Edit an existing project
Upload resources (.zip, .jpg. key, and a bunch of others.) (upload system)
I used a relational-database in order to keep track of all the projects. And an online drive to store all the resources on that automatically creates an hierarchy of all the projects and resources from each semester.

This project is open-source. I spent approximately 160 hours building this. It has been finished for about 85%.
